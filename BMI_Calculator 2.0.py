#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
#Under 18.5 they are underweight
#Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#Above 35 they are clinically obese
